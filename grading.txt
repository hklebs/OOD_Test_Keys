How Final Grades Were Computed in CS 3500 (spring 2012)

Three curves were applied before the overall numerical average
was computed.

Curve #1:  The percentage scores for assignments 2 and 5 were
compared, and the lower percentage score was dropped.  That
had the effect of reducing the number of scores for homework
assignments from 10 to 9.

Curve #2:  The most detrimental grade for the remaining
assignments was dropped.  That had the effect of reducing
the number of scores for homework assignments from 9 to 8.

The homework average was then computed by weighting those
8 scores equally.

Curve #3:  The final exam was a little harder than usual,
so the final exam score was curved by adding 7 points.

The overall average was then computed as a weighted average
of the homework average, midterm, and curved final exam:

    50%  homework average
    20%  midterm
    30%  final exam

The letter grades were then computed directly from the
overall average, with some slight lowering of some thresholds
at the whim of the instructor (to give slightly higher
letter grades to some students than would have been given
by a purely mechanical application of the algorithm above).
